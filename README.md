BTClip v0.1.0
=============

BTClip is a tool to share links to large files synced with tools like BTSync or OwnCloud.


For example:
------------

  1. Sync a folder (e.g. /home/starquake/BTSync/Public) with a folder on a webserver (e.g. http://example.org/public_files)

  2. Set the local path and the public URL

  3. Drag a file from the local folder onto the dashed square in the BTClip window.

  4. BTClip puts the public URL on the clipboard

  5. Paste the URL in your favorite email editor or instant messaging app.
